== TODO:
Incorporate entangled Affectors for behavior based on related properties.
Provide nano-scale effects simulation.
Provide quantum entanglement effects simulation.

-entanglement 
	- Affector can be entangled/not implicitly - call other Affector(s)
	or
	- have relationships on entity, that mark properties to be entangled
	  every property has an Affector and an EntangledAffector

	- how does EntangledAffector work?
	
-refactor
	- Resolvers -> EntityResolver, PropertyResolver
	- strDump -> EntityStrDump, PropertyStrDump
	
-implementation
	- consider geometry as a Property, than as an entity.
	- global Property(s) that affect all affectable Entity(s)
